# IAM Instance Roles

The modules in this folder are the standard IAM Instance roles that should be used when creating any VM in AWS.  Each of the roles created by the modules are for different circumstances.  <br><br>

Please see our confluence page for a full list of what each role grants access to https://wellcometrust.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INF/pages/916160538/IAM+Instance+Roles <br><br>

Remember the rule, use the role that grants the least access for the instance you are creating.

If you need any further help, contact Kate, Mark, or Sean :-)
